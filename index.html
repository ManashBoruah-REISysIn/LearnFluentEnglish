                    <li>Studying in Pune University was an important learning experience for me. I had great time with teachers. Expecially, you are a teacher who really took on resposibilities. Sometimes, you might be a little strict, but it was necessary to those naughty students. You treated me very lenient, so I think you are a really nice person. Even though, I am not study in Pune University any longer , you still are my dear teacher who gave me a really good impression. I wish you all the best.<br/><br/>-- Xueshan Huang</li>
                    <li>As far as i am concerned, my actual English level is all due to the efforts made by Mrs. Walia to inculcate the knowledge of English. It was done with delicacy, perspicacity, proficiency; indeed her ways were rigorous, she was strict but consequently, i achieved my aim though. She is helpful.<br/><br/>-- Geancy Bashala</li>
                    <li>i just like the way she leads and behaves like a mother .she can manage a group of English teachers well. she is a real expert in English as well. All in all , she is perfect and I do like her .<br/><br/>-- Milad</li>
                    <li>Mrs Walia is a very good and perfect English teacher. She teaches in all ways according to her students. She covers all aspects i.e writing , speaking, listening, grammar, each and every little thing which a student should know while learning English. She is very particular about her class timings. Very helpful and never screamed at anyone, very soft spoken. She is a very good person as a human being. Her way of teaching is very different from others.<br/><br/>-- Neha Sarda</li>
                    <li>Wallia maam is one of those teachers whome not only i learnt the english from her , but also she taught me how to be strong and behave in different situations.One of the positive point of her classes is that, she knows what to learn and not wasting too much time on easy problems so her classes wouldn't be boring.Managing an institute with many nationalities is hard job , but when Wallia maam is manager so you are sure that everything will be done in its best.Altough she is kind and sweet with students but sometimes its needed to be more strict with them.After all you can take so many advantages from her personality and knowledge.<br/><br/>--Elmira Ardebili</li>
                    <li>Mrs.Walia's English Speaking Class for U.G./working person. I saw this board so many times at cash counter of mall. But everytime I think it's not for housewife.so I let it go.but on 11th October I started thinking about about it again and I called her. It was my 1st interaction with her.she was so sweet atleast she gave green signal to join the class and before that she called me at her place. I went her place and I am relaxed when I saw her 1st time. Her personality is so pleasant . She resemble to actor Parl Padamsee . Very friendly and smiley face. She was just like what I had imagined. She is so supportive and makes us comfortable in the class. She is open and understanding so we share our thoughts openly. Thanks for being kind to us.<br/><br/>-- Shilpa pathak</li>
